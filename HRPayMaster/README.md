## Neon Database Setup

1. **Get a connection string**
   - Sign in to the [Neon](https://neon.tech) dashboard and copy the connection string for your project.
2. **Configure environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in this directory or add secrets via your hosting platform's UI.
   - Define the following variables:

     ```bash
     DATABASE_URL="<your Neon connection string>"
     SESSION_SECRET="<random session secret>"
     ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > `SESSION_SECRET` must be set in production. The server will refuse to
   > start without it to ensure session data remains secure.

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run migrations**

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

   - Requires the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
   - Run this step whenever you pull changes that modify the database schema.

5. **Start the application**
   - Development: `npm run dev`
   - Production: `npm run build` followed by `npm run start`

## Employee Import Guide

### Preparing the Excel file

- Save the file in **.xlsx** format.
- The **first row must contain column headers**.
- Each subsequent row represents one employee.
- Include at least the required columns:
  - `employeeCode`
  - `firstName`
  - `lastName`
  - `position`
  - `salary`
  - `startDate`
- Additional columns can be mapped to existing fields or custom fields.

### Using the mapping UI

1. Go to **Employees â†’ Import**.
2. Select your Excel file and click **Next** to detect headers.
3. For each detected column, use the dropdown to choose a system field or **Custom field**.
4. When choosing **Custom field**, enter a name to create a new field.
5. Ensure all required fields are mapped, then click **Import**.
6. The UI shows how many rows succeeded or failed.

### Expected server responses

| Scenario | Response |
| --- | --- |
| File uploaded without mapping | `200 { "headers": ["Code", ...] }` |
| Successful import | `200 { "success": <count>, "failed": <count> }` |
| Missing required mapping | `400 { "error": { "message": "Missing mapping for required fields: ..." } }` |
| Column not found / invalid mapping | `400 { "error": { "message": "Column 'X' not found in uploaded file" } }` |
| Server error | `500 { "error": { "message": "Failed to import employees" } }` |

**Troubleshooting**

- Verify the Excel file uses the `.xlsx` extension.
- Check that required fields are mapped and column names match the header row.
- Ensure employee codes are unique; duplicates are skipped and counted as failed.
- If the server returns an error, review the message and correct the mapping or data.
