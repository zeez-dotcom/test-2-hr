## Summary
- Ran `npm run check` to compile TypeScript.
- Fixed syntax error in `payroll-edit-view.tsx` by removing an extra closing `<div>`.
- Updated ImageUpload imports in `deduction-form.tsx` and `vacation-day-form.tsx` to use default export.

## Remaining Issues
- TypeScript compilation still reports numerous errors across components and pages.
- Many API request calls use incorrect parameter order and need refactoring.
- Data types for various fields (e.g., employee properties, document structures) require updates to match the shared schema.

## Next Steps
- Refactor API calls to match `apiRequest(method, url, data)` signature.
- Resolve missing or mismatched properties in payroll and report components.
- Add type definitions for server routes and shared schema to eliminate duplicates.
- Re-run `npm run check` until the project compiles successfully.
